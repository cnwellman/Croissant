    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      The humble croissant is a wonderous thing So much enjoyment to breakfast
      it can bring Some people like it filled with honey or jam While others
      prefer the savoury option cheese or ham It was taking a holiday in the
      centre of France I spotted a croissant in a bakery just by chance The
      unusual shape of the croissant caught my eye So I went into the bakers to
      give them a try Ever since that day I have been addicted and hooked I
      better go now as my croissant is cooked
