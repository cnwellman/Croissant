    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      The humble croissant is a wonderous thing; So much enjoyment to breakfast
      it can bring. Some people like it filled with honey or jam; While others
      prefer the savoury option cheese or ham. It was taking a holiday in the
      centre of France; I spotted a croissant in a bakery just by chance! The
      unusual shape of the croissant caught my eye; So I went into the bakers to
      give them a try. Ever since that day I have been addicted and hooked -- I
      better go now as my croissant is cooked!
